\title{Renormalize weights}

\description{This function creates a discrete probability distribution from a 
set of unnormalized (log) weights.}

\usage{renormalize.weights(weights, log=FALSE, engine="R")}

\arguments{
  \item{weights}{a vector of non-negative numbers}
  \item{log}{a logical indicating whether the weights are given as the logarithm
  of the weights}
  \item{engine}{run using "R" or "C" code}      
}
\value{a vector of probabilities that sum to 1}
